**Abstract:**
Prototypes of the new detectors are subjected to various tests during development. One of these tests is a testing with a beam of charged particles (which called beam test), there is a problem of positioning the experimental setup relative to the beam in conditions when the detector under study is on the beam for a limited time, since existing beam monitors are expensive and inconvenient to use in this capacity. In most cases, positioning is done manually, which takes an extremely expensive acceleration time.
To solve this problem, it is proposed to use a coordinate table with a detector on a silicon photomultiplier. The movement of the detector will be controlled by manual input via the controller, or by using software code that provides intelligent beam search. Also, the SiPM-based detector will be set to match the beam trigger to exclude the search for the beam during its absence. A cross-shaped self-leveling laser pointer will be used to visualize the process.
This project involves the design, 3D modeling, construction and testing of the installation. The developed installation allows you to conveniently and quickly position the detector under study for beam research.
